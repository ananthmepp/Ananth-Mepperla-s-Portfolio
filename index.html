                  Subtle Telugu Traits and Dating(STT)
                  <span class="title-small">Founder/ March 2019</span>
                </h3>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  Subtle Telugu Traits and Dating is Facebook group that I created in the March of 2019, initially to
                  provide a platform for my generation to be able to share relatable content, have discussions, but more importantly to share memes. There are other "subtle" meme pages, for specific ethnicitites
                  in the world, so I thought of making a meme page that would be more targeted towards a specific region/dialect in India.
                  All memes put aside, I would like to say the group is more of a community then anything else. The page has 38,865
                  and growing members by the day! To make sure out community is safe zone, I have a group of moderators, along with myself, who go through and approve
                  posts and member requests, to make sure all content is appropriate. Our members come from all over the world, Australia, US, Germany, and more. 35K is very large amount, but there is very big sense of community and
                  support for one and other inside the group, whether that be showing support to each other on posts and threads or simply following each other on social media.
                  We as a page talk about issues that are happening not only in our own community but the world itself. Recently as a page we raised $1,500 to donate towards the Black Lives Matter movment. Currently we are partnering with a dance team based in
                  Dallas to host a NBA 2K tournament to raise money towards the Yeman Crisis.
                  All in all members have grown close to their current friends and have grown close enough to their new internet pen-pals, that a lot of people took the extra step of putting a FaceTime Contact
                  to a face! I personally am gratefull for the friends I have made and have grown close from the page.

                <p class="mb-0">
                  In my journey to becoming an Eagle Scout I had to organize and lead a community service project in which I showcased my leadership, organizational, and planning skills. For my Eagle Scout project I built two shoe racks at a Hindu temple. At Hindu places of worship, wearing footwear and walking inside the common hall where the deities are present is prohibited. My Eagle Project helped the visiting devotees keep their footwear at one place and in an organized fashion this helps both devotees and temple organization from being a mess and having a pool of shoes spread out all over the place. I led a group of volunteers from start to finish on how to properly build the shoe racks.
